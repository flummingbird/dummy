# Basic Git for Poe Project
To put it simply, 
Git is a code repository with version control. [GitHub][df3]
  - https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  - git works on [linux][df1], [mac][df1], and [windows][df2]

git can be complicated (and awesome) but we're only going to need a few commands for this project.
* git clone  (downloads a repository from a site to the present working directory)
* git status (good to know what's up)
* git add  (add this file to my commit)
* git rm   (remove file from commit)
* git commit (commit to the commit, and leave a message -m 'please')
* git push  (after commiting, we push to the remote repository living on github)
* git pull (pulls in changes made from the repositoy)
* git diff (helps show the difference between your changes and the remote repositroy)

I know that's alot to take in but trust me, you'll get the hang of it.

### Getting started with a command line. 
Open a terminal or command line utility (git bash)
There are a few usefull commands for the command line that you should know:
* pwd (stands for preset working directory)
* cd (change directory)
* ls (list)
